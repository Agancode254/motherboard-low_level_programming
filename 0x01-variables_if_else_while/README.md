C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of variables, if-else statements, and while loops in the C programming language. It covers the following topics:

Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). These operators are used to manipulate numerical values in C programs.

Logical Operators:
Logical operators, also known as boolean operators, include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). They are used to combine multiple conditions in if-else statements or while loops to make decisions based on boolean expressions.

Relational Operators:
Relational operators are used to compare values and include == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to). They are commonly used in if-else statements and while loops to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.

TRUE and FALSE Values:
In C, any non-zero value is considered TRUE, while a value of zero is considered FALSE. This concept is often used in conditional statements and loops to determine whether a condition is true or false.

Boolean Operators:
Boolean operators are used to manipulate boolean values and include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). They are used to combine or invert boolean expressions in C programs.

If-Else Statements:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, while the if-else statement allows for the execution of alternative code if the condition is false.

Comments:
Comments in C are used to document code and improve its readability. Single-line comments begin with //, while multi-line comments are enclosed between /* and */.

Variable Declaration and Assignment:
Variables in C must be declared before use, specifying their data type (char, int, unsigned int) and optionally their initial value. They can be assigned values using the assignment operator (=).

Printing Variables with printf:
The printf function is used to print formatted output in C. Variables of type char, int, and unsigned int can be printed using %c, %d, and %u format specifiers, respectively.

While Loop:
The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is often used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

ASCII Character Set:
The ASCII character set is a standard character encoding scheme that assigns numerical values to characters. It includes letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters.

GCC Flags -m32 and -m64:
The -m32 flag instructs the GCC compiler to generate 32-bit code, while the -m64 flag generates 64-bit code. These flags specify the target architecture for the compiled executable.
